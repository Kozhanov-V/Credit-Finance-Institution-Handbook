# Credit-Finance-Institution-Handbook üìñ
## Description üèª

This is a web application for administering reference information about credit finance institutions. It includes functionality for adding, editing, and deleting records through the user interface, as well as a mechanism for batch uploading and updating reference data based on the information provided by the Central Bank of Russia. The application provides API access for "external" services to reference information and its search.

## Technologies

- Backend:
  - Spring Boot 
  - Spring MVC 
  - Spring Data 
- Database:
   - .h2 
- Frontend:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Vue.js
## Implementation Details ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- The API is described using Swagger (http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).
- The application has a configurable logger.
- The interface is user-friendly (warnings, messages, highlights).
- It avoids the problem of duplicate clicks to delete/save/update in case of "freezing" of the network/server and other factors.
- Problems in the application (backend or front) should not stump the user (it is unacceptable to display a white screen, server errors in the form of Stacktrace, codes 400-500, and others).
